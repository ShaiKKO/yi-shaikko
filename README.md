Yi is a collection of packages that serve as building blocks for making your very own text editor.

## Installation

Just running `stack install yi` or `cabal install -j yi` would be akin to unwrapping a box of lego and
finding an assembled spaceship there.
Note that this way, it will not be possible to use a custom configuration.

In order to have a personalized configuration, it is necessary to use Yi as libraries to create your own text editor.

A good starting point is choosing an example configuration of your liking in the
[example-configs][userconfigs] directory, building it, running it, and tinkering with it.

#### Static vs dynamic

Yi used to have a dynamic configuration (*Ã  la* Xmonad). So each time after the configuration was changed, Yi needed recompilation before starting.

Now, it's recommended to use a static configuration which makes it possible to distribute binaries without the entire Haskell ecosystem.

*Dynamic configuration is still available using a [separate package](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/yi-dynamic-configuration).*

See this [article](https://yi-editor.github.io/posts/2017-01-06-dyre/) for more detailed explanations about static and dynamic configuration.

### Static example configurations
The static example configurations don't need to be placed in any specific directory (but you can still use `~/.config/yi`).
   1. Copy the example configuration (only the contents of the folder) to your `yi` folder.
   2. Install the configuration (with `stack install` or `cabal install`).
   *Make sure the folder where stack (or cabal) installs executables is on your PATH.*
   3. Run Yi with the command found in the package.yaml file under the executables line (i.e. `yi-vty-emacs` for the emacs config). You can also change the executable name here.

### Dynamic example configurations
 You can install this just like the static configuration. Make sure to copy the example configuration in the `~/.config/yi` folder. After step 3, you should be able to just use the `yi` command to launch Yi. If you change your configuration file Yi automatically detects your changes and rebuilds itself.

See this [documentation page](https://yi-editor.github.io/pages/installing/)
for more detailed installation instructions. Hacking instructions if you're
using the nix package manager are also there.

## Configuration

Yi, as a library, can be categorized into four parts :

* *Frontends* are responsible for rendering the editor state and passing user events to the core ;
    * a "textual" editor using [yi-frontend-vty](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/yi-frontend-vty)
    * a "graphical" one using [yi-frontend-pango](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/yi-frontend-pango)
    * or both
    
 * *Actions* describe how to interact with the editor, and it's the part that makes most of Yi. It is structured around a stack of three monadic DSLs:
   * **BufferM** for all buffer-local operations, like insertion, deletion of text, and annotation of buffer contents. It can be understood as a monad that encapsulates the state of one buffer.
   * **EditorM** for editor-level operations, e.g., opening and closing windows and buffers. Operations involving *more than one buffer are handled at this level too.*
   * **YiM** for IO-level operations. There, one can operate on files, processes, etc. *This is the only level where IO can be performed.*

 * *Keymaps* represent how to trigger actions, they serve as the basis to use or to create the ones you need;
    * [vim-like](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/yi-keymap-vim)
    * [emacs-like](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/yi-keymap-emacs)
    * [cua-like](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/yi-keymap-cua)
    * Acme (Plan 9 style)
    * Joe (Joe's Own Editor)
    * Mg (Micro GNU Emacs)
    * Ee (Easy Editor)
  
* *Glue code*, how the three other parts are shaped together.

### Syntax Highlighting

Yi supports both incremental and asynchronous syntax highlighting:

* **Incremental highlighting** - Built-in scanner-based system that updates as you type
* **Async highlighting** - External parser integration that runs in background threads:
  * Tree-sitter support for modern language parsing
  * LSP semantic tokens for language server integration  
  * Custom parser interface for any external tool
  * Non-blocking UI even on large files

See [yi-async-syntax-example.hs](example-configs/yi-async-syntax-example.hs) for configuration examples.

#### External configuration examples

Some people share their Yi configurations here on [github](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=yi-config+language%3Ahaskell&type=).
